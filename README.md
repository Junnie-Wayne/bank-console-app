A java console application to simulate a simple banking system with deposit, withdrawal and check balance features.
It is more like a repetitive system in the sense that after making a choice for any of the features, the system takes the user of the program back to the main menu for further selection.
Until the user ends the program via the final option("Exit"), the program will still continue landing on the main menu after the selection of an option and its respective output.
This actually helps to monitor deposit made, the difference in the account balance after withdrawal and the actual balance generally unlike just depositing or withdrawing and the program just ends, making the state of the account inaccessible or somewhat cleared after the end of the program.
